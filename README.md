## Using the App

In order to use the app, you'll need to set up an account. Simply put in an email of your choice and a 6-or-more digit password, and click "Sign Up." The page will take you to your <b>profile</b>, where you can navigate to the <b>map</b> page or the <b>post</b> page.

#### Posting a Trick
In order to post a trick, upload it to youtube, and link it on the post page, along with a title. Be sure to be in the place you performed the trick, as that is where the app will log the trick.

#### Using the Map

#### Viewing your Profile
After you've posted your trick, you can see it on the map page, as well as listed under "Your Tricks" on your Profile page.
